            <p>Far Away. The ideologies of the super-tribes exercised absolute power over all individual minds under

                mental tyranny. In relation to his natural tribe, at least if it was small and genuinely civilized, the

            <p>Fierce is a multidisciplinary exhibition and related symposium organized at Parsons The New School for
                Design in November 2013, exploring fashion culture by means of contemporary art, design and media. The
                exhibited works comment on the unsustainability of the fashion industry, investigate how people use
                clothes as tools for building their identities, and analyze the relationship of fashion and
                corporeality.</p>
